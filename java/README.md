This folder contains the sources of the two additional Java projects required for the `PaDEL_pywrapper`:

- the `elibPaDEL-Descriptor.jar` library the second relies on,
- the `ePaDEL.jar` executable called by `PaDEL_pywrapper`.

Both Java projects were created with IntelliJ IDEA 2022.3.2 (Community Edition).
